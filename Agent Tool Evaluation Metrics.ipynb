            "- **age**: SHAP value of -0.0639868, indicating that the age of the individual slightly decreases the likelihood of the income being above $50K.\n",

            "- **marital-status_Married-civ-spouse**: SHAP value of 0.0632274, which significantly increases the likelihood of having an income above $50K. This is the most impactful positive feature for this prediction.\n",
